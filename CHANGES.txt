1.1 (Unreleased)
-------------------

- Events now include a className which is the
  combination of all Subjects it is tagged with,
  giving designers some more to play with.
  Class names are normalized using the standard plone
  mechanism.
  E.g. for an event Subject=['A subject', 'Subject 10!'] 
  we add className="Subject_a-subject Subject_subject-10".
